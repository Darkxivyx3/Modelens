                    <p class="section-content">Sourin India wanted to establish a strong presence on Instagram for their
                        bags. The goal was to create visually striking content that would capture the brand's innovative
                        spirit and showcase their products effectively using different models and their various
                        different styles and coloured bags within limited time frame. The challenge was to develop a
                        photoshoot that not only highlighted the bags but also appealed to a broad Instagram audience.
